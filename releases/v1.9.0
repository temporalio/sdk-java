Highlights:

This release is focused on providing new Search Attributes functionality:
  - New `Workflow.getSearchAttribute(String)`, `Workflow.getSearchAttributeValues(String)`,
    `Workflow.getSearchAttributes()` methods to get deserialized search attributes
  - unit tests can register new search attributes on both Test Server and dockerized Temporal Server
  - unit tests can use Test Server to verify search attributes behavior and implementation.

Test server exposes new gRPC TestService providing time skipping API to be used in other SDKs.

An upgrade of Temporal Server and Temporal docker-compose to 1.16 is highly recommended to use the new Search Attribute APIs.

Fixes:

- Edge case of "unexpected event WORKFLOW_TASK_COMPLETED" when querying a non-completed workflow evicted from sticky cache #1134
- Deadlock Detection may cause "Operation allowed only while eventLoop is running" in the workflow code #1127
- Protobuf version range that was making 1.8.x release hard to use with Maven
