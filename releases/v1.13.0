Highlights:

Release focused on resiliency of Workflow Workers.

Fixes:

- Fix Version State Machine ignoring range check during replay if the history was unversioned
- Fix cancellation of child workflows in some edge cases
- Fix awaiting on child workflow start not throwing exceptions if the start is not possible leading to stuck workflows
- Added more guards and workflow invalidation logic to make sure history events are not applied to outdated or too advanced state of the workflow
- and other
