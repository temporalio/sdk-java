# Highlights

## Bugfixes

- Fixes an issue with versioning in signal handlers leading to non determinism.
- Fixes an issue with ScheduleClient not throwing an exception on a failed create

## Readonly Protection

Added protection in the SDK against running mutating workflow functions in a read only context.
A read only context is a query handler, update validator, side effect, or mutable side effect.
Previously, in some cases, the SDK would seem to allow it but silently generate an invalid workflow history.
This change allows developers to quickly catch their mistake and prevents generating invalid workflow histories
