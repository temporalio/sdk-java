Highlights:

This release mostly contains changes and fixes for the WorkflowClient and WorkflowStub behavior.

Fixes:

- sticky_cache_size, stale version may be observed
- Fixed a problem with test server not respecting disabled time skipping introduced in 1.9.0
- SDK doesn't log exceptions internally that are getting propagated to the user code anymore
- Behavior of Workflow#getResult, WorkflowStub#cancel and WorkflowStub#terminate got aligned with their contract for exceptions
