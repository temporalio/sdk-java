# Highlights

In v1.24.0 the Java SDK fixed a bug causing the initial connection health check and server capabilities discovery
to not have a proper deadline set. Some users may have been unintentionally relying on this lack of deadline when
the first request to the Temporal service is slow. This release adds a new option to configure the deadline of
this initial connection. Added ServiceStubsOptions.setSystemInfoTimeout() to configure the deadline of this
initial connection. Setting the deadline to your RPC timeout would emulate the previous behavior of not having
a deadline set.
