# **💥 BREAKING CHANGES**

## TLS When API Key Is Provided

TLS is now enabled automatically when an API key is provided to the client.

If you currently use an API key without TLS, you will need to adjust your connection configuration or explicitly disable TLS where appropriate.

## Search Attributes on Continue-As-New

When a workflow continues-as-new without explicitly setting search attributes, the SDK now carries over the previous execution's search attributes.

If your code relied on search attributes being cleared on continue-as-new when none were set, you must now explicitly set or clear them as needed.

# **Highlights**

## Plugin Support

This release adds plugin support for the Java SDK, making it easier to design features that customizes SDK behavior.

## Worker Versioning and Environment Config

Removed experimental warnings for worker versioning and environment configuration; these features are now considered stable.

## gRPC Security Upgrade

Upgraded gRPC to 1.75.0 to address CVE-2025-55163 and CVE-2025-24970.

## workflowcheck (Experimental)

Initial support for the Java static analyzer (workflowcheck) to help validate workflow code (experimental).
