# **ðŸ’¥ BREAKING CHANGES**

# API Keys
The SDK will now automatically set the `temporal-namespace` header on all gRPC request made by the `WorkflowClient`. Users
should no longer manually set this header.

To use API keys users should follow this example:

```java
    WorkflowServiceStubs service =
        WorkflowServiceStubs.newServiceStubs(
            WorkflowServiceStubsOptions.newBuilder()
                .addApiKey(
                    () ->
                        <API key>)
                .setTarget(<endpoint>)
                .setEnableHttps(true)
                ...
                .build());

    WorkflowClient client =
        WorkflowClient.newInstance(
            service, WorkflowClientOptions.newBuilder().setNamespace(<namespace_id>.<account_id>).build());
```
