# Highlights

Comprehensive rework of Local Activity Worker implementation:

- Local Activities now respect all the timeouts set on `LocalActivityOptions`.
- Lower ScheduleToStart latencies for Local Activities and a backpressure that prefers retries over new executions
- `LocalActivityOptions` got `scheduleToStart` timeout
- Bugfix for OpenTelemetry/OpenTracing incorrectly showing exaggerated scheduleToStart latency for Local Activities (#1573)

Spring Boot module got

- Spring Boot 3 support
- `*Options` Customizer beans for fine grained control over `*Options` instances used by Spring Boot
- Workers names based configuration to keep Task Queue names contained in the config only
- More wired `WorkflowFactoryOptions` and `WorkerOptions` properties
- Bugfixes for beans ordering (#1614) and test environment setup (#1622)

New `WorkflowClient` methods:

- `WorkflowClient#listExecutions` for fetching and iterating through Workflow Executions based on Visibility Queries
- `WorkflowClient#fetchHistory` and `WorkflowClient#streamHistory` for retrieving Workflow history from the Server to be used in replay or for export.

New metadata methods available for Workflow code:

- `WorkflowInfo#getHistoryLength()`
- `WorkflowInfo#getFirstExecutionRunId()`
- `WorkflowInfo#getOriginalExecutionRunId()`

# Bugfixes

- Query on a stub that was was used for start a workflow now follows chain of runIds (#1612)
- Failures happened in Signal methods are now treated the same way as failures in Workflow methods (#1616)

# Migration note

Previously Local Activity Workers didn't respect `startToClose` and, in some cases, `scheduleToClose` timeouts.
Some users may have `LocalActivityOptions` configurations that don't accommodate their actual timings but previously were unenforced.
The enforcement will kick in after an upgrade on v1.18+ and may lead to Local Activity failures that were not happening before.
Users may need to test and adjust their `LocalActivityOptions` timeouts before rolling out v1.18+ to production.
