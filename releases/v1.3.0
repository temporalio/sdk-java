Highlights:
* Improved Kotlin support (#319) Kotlin users should include temporal-kotlin module in the classpath.
* Context deadline exceeded gRPC error will be considered as non-retryable (#654) and will include details from the previous exception when possible (#674). Normal behavior for most other retryable server errors would be to retry them until deadline is exceeded.
* Added support for JWT tokens (#678)
* Allowed using custom headers during health check (#690)
* Multiple bug fixes
