 * Can be used to intercept calls from a Nexus operation into the Temporal APIs.

 * methods you need instead of implementing this interface directly. {@link
 * NexusOperationOutboundCallsInterceptorBase} provides correct default implementations to all the
 * methods of this interface.
 *
 * <p>An instance may be created in {@link
 * NexusOperationInboundCallsInterceptor#init(NexusOperationOutboundCallsInterceptor)} and set by
 * passing it into {@code init} method of the {@code next} {@link
 * NexusOperationInboundCallsInterceptor} The implementation must forward all the calls to the
 * outbound interceptor passed as a {@code outboundCalls} parameter to the {@code init} call.
