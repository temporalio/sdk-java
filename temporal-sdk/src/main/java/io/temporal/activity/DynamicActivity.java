 * Use DynamicActivity to implement any number of activity types dynamically. When an activity

 * invocation that doesn't have an explicitly registered handler. Only one instance that implements
 * DynamicActivity per {@link io.temporal.worker.Worker} is allowed.
 *
 * <p>The DynamicActivity can be useful for integrations with existing libraries. For example, it
 * can be used to call some external HTTP API with each function exposed as a different activity
 * type.
 *
 * <p>Use {@link Activity#getExecutionContext()} to query information about the activity type that
 * should be implemented dynamically.
