 * Use DynamicWorkflow to implement any number of workflow types dynamically. When a workflow
 * implementation type that extends DynamicWorkflow is registered, it is used to implement any
 * workflow type that is not implicitly registered with the {@link io.temporal.worker.Worker}. Only
 * one type that implements DynamicWorkflow per worker is allowed.
 *
 * <p>The main use case for DynamicWorkflow is an implementation of custom Domain Specific Languages
 * (DSLs). A single implementation can implement a workflow type whose definition is dynamically
 * loaded from some external source.
 *
 * <p>Use {@link Workflow#getInfo()} to query information about the workflow type that should be
 * implemented dynamically.
 *
 * <p>Use {@link Workflow#registerListener(Object)} to register signal and query listeners. Consider
 * using {@link DynamicSignalHandler} and {@link DynamicQueryHandler} to implement handlers that can
 * support any signal or query type dynamically.
 *
 * <p>All the determinism rules still apply to workflows that implement this interface.
