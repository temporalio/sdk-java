   * {@code sideEffect} call in non-replay mode results in a new marker event recorded into the

   * During the replay, {@code mutableSideEffect} will not execute the function again, but it will
   * return the exact same value as it was returning during the non-replay run.
   *
   * <p>One good use case of {@code mutableSideEffect} is to access a dynamically changing config
   * without breaking determinism. Even if called very frequently the config value is recorded only
   * when it changes not causing any performance degradation due to a large history size.
   *
   * <p>Caution: do not use {@code mutableSideEffect} function to modify any workflow state. Only
   * use the mutableSideEffect's return value.

   *     ids are completely independent.
   * @param func function that gets as input a result of a previous {@code mutableSideEffect} call.
   *     The function executes its business logic (like checking config value) and if value didn't
   *     change returns {@link Optional#empty()}. If value has changed and needs to be recorded in
   *     the history then it is returned instead.

   *     cached result of the func.
