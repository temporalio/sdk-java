This directory contains the core Temporal SDK code, which is used to build Temporal applications. The SDK provides a set of APIs and libraries that allow developers to create, manage, and execute workflows and activities in a distributed environment. The SDK is designed to be easy to use and provides a high-level abstraction over the underlying Temporal service.

The SDK is written in Java and is designed to be used with the Temporal service. It provides a set of APIs for defining workflows and activities, as well as for managing the execution of those workflows and activities.

# Testing
